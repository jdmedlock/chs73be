## Overview

CHS73BE is the backend application server supporting  the Central High School Class of 1973
reunion website. The goal of the website is to generate anticipation among
alumni, inform them about reunion news and upcoming events, and to periodically
poll members for their opinions.

## Application Architecture

The application consists of a web frontend ([this repo](https://github.com/jdmedlock/chs73)).
This backend provides services for the FE including emailing and managing classmate & faculty
data. GraphQL is used to request email services, while a traditional REST API
is used for processing classmate & faculty data.

The frontend is built using these libraries, services, and tools:

| Dependency  | Description                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| Airtable    | Data source for classmate, faculty, & payment history |
| ExpressJS   | Web server functionality    |
| GraphQL     | GraphQL API services        |
| node-mailjet | MailJet API services       |

## routes

| Dependency  | Description                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------|
| /classmates   | Retrieve all classmates info |
| /faculty      | Retreive all faculty member info |
| /logPayment   | Create a payment record in Airtable |
| /sendEventAck | Send a payment aknowledgement email |
| /wakeup       | Wakeup the server         |
## Installation & Configuration

1. Clone or fork this repo using git. Don't forget that to create a runnable application you'll also need the backend.

2. `npm install`

3. To run the app locally enter `npm run dev`

4. Open a new browser window and navigate to the URL `http://localhost:3100` (or whatever port you've specified in `.env`). This assumes that you haven't changed the default port number.

### Environment variables

The following environment variables must be set up for the app to run properly:

| Key              | Value                                |
|------------------|--------------------------------------|
| AIRTABLE_API_KEY     | Your unique Airtable API key     |
| AIRTABLE_BASE        | Id of the Airtable base containing the data |
| MAILJET_API_KEY      | Your unique MailJet API key      |
| MAILJET_SECRET_KEY   | Your MailJet secret key          |
| EMAIL_RECIPIENT_ADDR | Recipient address for emails     |
| EMAIL_RECIPIENT_NAME | Recipient name for emails        |
| EMAIL_SENDER_ADDR    | Sender address for emails        |
| EMAIL_SENDER_ADDR    | Sender address for emails        |
| PORT                 | Server port number (default: 3100) |
